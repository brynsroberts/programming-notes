Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that focus on how objects and classes interact and communicate with one another to accomplish a particular behavior or task. These patterns deal with the assignment of responsibilities between objects, how they collaborate to achieve a common goal, and how they communicate with each other to achieve that goal. Behavioral patterns are often used to manage complex workflows, control the flow of data between objects, and ensure that objects are decoupled and maintain a clear separation of concerns.

Some examples of behavioral design patterns include the [[Observer]] pattern, which defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically; the [[Strategy]] pattern, which defines a family of algorithms and encapsulates each one so that they can be interchanged at runtime; and the Command pattern, which encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
