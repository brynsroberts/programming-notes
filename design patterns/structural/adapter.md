The Adapter pattern is used when we need to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by creating a middle layer or an adapter between them.

Here is an example of implementing the Adapter pattern in Python:

```python
class Target:
    def request(self):
        pass


class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return "Adaptee specific request."


class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        return f"Adapter: (Translated) {self.adaptee.specific_request()}"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    adaptee = Adaptee()
    adapter = Adapter(adaptee)

    print(adaptee.specific_request())
    print(adapter.request())
```

In this example, we have a `Target` interface that defines the expected interface of the objects we want to use. We also have an `Adaptee` class that has a different interface than the `Target` interface. Finally, we have an `Adapter` class that implements the `Target` interface and uses an instance of the `Adaptee` class to translate the requests from the `Target` interface to the `Adaptee` interface.

In the main program, we create an instance of the `Adaptee` class and an instance of the `Adapter` class that takes the `Adaptee` instance as a parameter. We then call the `specific_request` method of the `Adaptee` instance, which returns a string representing the specific request of the `Adaptee` interface. We also call the `request` method of the `Adapter` instance, which returns a string representing the translated request of the `Target` interface.

In this way, we have successfully used the `Adaptee` and `Target` objects together, even though they have incompatible interfaces, by using the `Adapter` class as a middle layer to translate the requests from one interface to the other.
