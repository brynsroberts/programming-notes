Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. They provide ways to create objects in a more flexible, reusable and maintainable way. The creational design patterns aim to abstract the object instantiation process and hide the complexities of the creation process from the client code that uses the objects.

Some common creational design patterns include:

1.  [[Singleton]]: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
2.  [[Factory]] Method: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
3.  [[Abstract Factory]]: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying their concrete classes.
4.  [[Builder]]: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

By using creational design patterns, we can write more modular, extensible and reusable code. They also make it easier to test our code, as we can replace object creation with mock objects or other test doubles.
