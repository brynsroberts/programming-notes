Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with the relationships between objects and how they are composed to form larger structures. These patterns focus on creating simple and efficient relationships between objects and classes to make them easier to use, maintain, and modify. Some common structural design patterns include:

1.  [[Adapter]] Pattern: This pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a bridge between them.
4.  Decorator Pattern: This pattern allows you to add new functionality to an object dynamically by wrapping it with another object that provides the new functionality.
5.  [[Facade]] Pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system by creating a higher-level interface that hides the complexity of the system.

These design patterns are widely used in software development to improve code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.
