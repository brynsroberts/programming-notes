VPS stands for Virtual Private Server. It is a type of hosting service that provides users with a virtual server that is partitioned from a larger physical server. Each VPS operates independently and has its own resources, operating system, and software.

VPS hosting is popular among website owners and developers because it provides a dedicated environment at a lower cost than a physical server. It allows users to customize their server settings, install software and applications, and have greater control over their hosting environment.

VPS hosting is also scalable, meaning that users can easily upgrade or downgrade their resources as their needs change. It is a flexible and cost-effective solution for those who require more resources than shared hosting can provide, but do not want to invest in a dedicated server.
