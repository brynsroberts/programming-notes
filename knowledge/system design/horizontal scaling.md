Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, is a method of increasing the resources available to an application or service by adding more servers to distribute the load. Instead of upgrading the existing server with more resources, multiple servers are added to share the load of the application or service.

Horizontal scaling is often used when an application or service is handling increasing amounts of traffic or users, and the load on the server is becoming too high to handle. By adding more servers, the workload can be distributed across the servers, resulting in better performance and increased capacity.

One advantage of horizontal scaling is that it can be more cost-effective than [[vertical scaling]], as it allows for a more modular and flexible infrastructure. Instead of investing in expensive, high-end hardware, multiple low-end servers can be used, which are often more affordable.

However, horizontal scaling also presents some challenges, including the need for [[load balancing]], [[data consistency]], and increased complexity of the infrastructure. Load balancing is necessary to ensure that requests are evenly distributed across the servers, while data consistency requires careful management of data across the multiple servers. The increased complexity of the infrastructure can also make it more difficult to manage and troubleshoot issues.

Overall, horizontal scaling is a powerful method for increasing the capacity and performance of applications and services, but it requires careful planning and management to ensure that it is implemented correctly.
