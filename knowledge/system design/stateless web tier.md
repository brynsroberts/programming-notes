A stateless web tier is a design pattern used in web applications where the web server does not maintain any client-specific data or [[session]] information between requests. Each client request is treated as an independent transaction, and the web server does not rely on any previous interactions with the client.

In this design, the web server is responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and sending back responses. It does not maintain any client-specific data or state information, which is typically stored in the backend or database layer.

Stateless web tier architecture is beneficial for scalability, as it allows for easy [[horizontal scaling]] by adding more web servers to handle incoming requests. It also simplifies the application design and reduces the chances of data inconsistencies between servers.

However, a stateless web tier can have some disadvantages, such as increased network traffic due to the need to send client information with each request, and the need for the backend layer to manage and store session data. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the application requirements and choose the appropriate design pattern accordingly.
