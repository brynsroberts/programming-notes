A public [[IP address]] and a private IP address are two different types of IP addresses used to identify devices on a [[network]].

A public IP address is an IP address that is assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is accessible over the public internet. This type of IP address is unique and can be used to identify a device on the internet. Public IP addresses are used for devices such as web servers, email servers, and other devices that need to be accessible from the internet.

A private IP address is an IP address that is assigned to a device on a local network, such as a home or office network. These IP addresses are used to identify devices on the local network and are not accessible from the internet. Private IP addresses are used for devices such as computers, printers, and other devices that only need to be accessed from within the local network.

Private IP addresses are reserved for internal networks and cannot be used on the public internet. The most commonly used private IP address ranges are 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255.

It's worth noting that devices on a local network may use a private IP address to communicate with other devices on the same network, but when they access the internet, they do so through a router that uses a public IP address. The router handles the translation of the private IP addresses used on the local network to the public IP address used on the internet.
