RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a technology used to combine multiple physical hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) into a single logical unit for data storage. RAID provides data redundancy, increased performance, and fault tolerance to prevent data loss in the event of a drive failure.

There are several levels of RAID, each with its own benefits and trade-offs. The most commonly used levels are:

-   RAID 0: This level uses striping to split data across multiple drives, which can improve performance but does not provide redundancy or fault tolerance. If one drive fails, all data stored on the array is lost.

-   RAID 1: This level uses mirroring to create an exact copy of the data on two or more drives, providing redundancy in case of a drive failure. However, it does not offer increased performance.

-   RAID 5: This level uses striping with parity to provide both performance and redundancy. If one drive fails, the data can be rebuilt from the parity information stored on the remaining drives.

-   RAID 6: This level is similar to RAID 5 but uses two sets of parity information to provide additional redundancy in case of multiple drive failures.

-   RAID 10: This level combines both mirroring and striping, providing high performance and redundancy. Data is mirrored across pairs of drives, and then striped across those pairs.

RAID can be implemented using hardware or software, and each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Hardware RAID is typically faster and more reliable, but also more expensive. Software RAID, on the other hand, is less expensive and more flexible, but may require more processing power and can be slower.
