DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is a system used to translate domain names (such as google.com) into P addresses (such as 172.217.164.206) that are used to locate web resources on the Internet. DNS is often described as the "phone book" of the Internet, as it maps human-readable domain names to machine-readable IP addresses.

When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser first sends a request to a DNS resolver, which is usually provided by the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP). The DNS resolver looks up the domain name in a distributed database called the DNS hierarchy, which contains information about the domain name and its associated IP address.

If the DNS resolver has the IP address for the [[domain name]] in its cache, it returns the [[IP address]] to the user's web browser, which then uses the IP address to connect to the server hosting the web resource. If the DNS resolver does not have the IP address in its cache, it sends a query to other DNS servers in the hierarchy, starting with the authoritative name servers for the domain name, until it finds the IP address.

DNS is an essential component of the Internet infrastructure, as it enables users to access web resources using easy-to-remember domain names rather than complex IP addresses. However, it is also a potential point of vulnerability, as attackers can use DNS spoofing or DNS hijacking techniques to redirect users to malicious websites or intercept their communications. Therefore, it is important to ensure that DNS servers are secure and properly configured to prevent these types of attacks.
