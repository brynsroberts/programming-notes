The Observer pattern is a [[behavioral]] design pattern that allows one-to-many relationships between objects, where one object (the subject) notifies other objects (the observers) when it changes its state.

In Python, the Observer pattern can be implemented using a combination of classes and interfaces. Here's an example implementation of the Observer pattern in Python:

```python
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(self)

class ConcreteSubject(Subject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._state = None

    def get_state(self):
        return self._state

    def set_state(self, state):
        self._state = state
        self.notify()

class Observer:
    def update(self, subject):
        pass

class ConcreteObserver1(Observer):
    def update(self, subject):
        print("ConcreteObserver1: Subject state has changed to", subject.get_state())

class ConcreteObserver2(Observer):
    def update(self, subject):
        print("ConcreteObserver2: Subject state has changed to", subject.get_state())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    subject = ConcreteSubject()
    observer1 = ConcreteObserver1()
    observer2 = ConcreteObserver2()

    subject.attach(observer1)
    subject.attach(observer2)

    subject.set_state("New state")
    subject.detach(observer1)

    subject.set_state("Another new state")
```

In this example, we have a `Subject` class that maintains a list of observers and provides methods to attach, detach, and notify the observers when its state changes. The `ConcreteSubject` class is a subclass of `Subject` that stores its state and notifies its observers when the state changes.

The `Observer` class is an abstract class that defines the interface for updating the observers when the subject changes. The `ConcreteObserver1` and `ConcreteObserver2` classes are concrete observers that implement the `update()` method to print out the updated state of the subject.

In the `main` method, we create a `ConcreteSubject` object, two `ConcreteObserver` objects, and attach them to the subject using the `attach()` method. We then change the state of the subject using the `set_state()` method, which triggers the `notify()` method to notify all the attached observers of the change. Finally, we detach `ConcreteObserver1` from the subject using the `detach()` method and change the state again, which only notifies `ConcreteObserver2`.
