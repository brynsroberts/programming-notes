The Fluent Builder pattern is a [[design pattern]] used in object-oriented programming to simplify the creation of complex objects. In Python, it is typically implemented as a class that uses method chaining to set various properties of the object being constructed, making it easy to create objects with many optional parameters.

Here is an example implementation of the Fluent Builder pattern in Python:

```python
class PersonBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.person = Person()

    def with_name(self, name):
        self.person.name = name
        return self

    def with_age(self, age):
        self.person.age = age
        return self

    def with_address(self, address):
        self.person.address = address
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.person
```



In this example, the `PersonBuilder` class contains several methods that allow you to set various properties of a `Person` object. Each method returns `self`, allowing you to chain multiple method calls together.

You can use this pattern to create a `Person` object with only the properties you need, like this:

```python
person = PersonBuilder().with_name('John').with_age(30).build()
```

This will create a `Person` object with a name of "John" and an age of 30. If you want to set additional properties, you can simply chain more method calls:

```python
person = PersonBuilder().with_name('John').with_age(30).with_address('123 Main St.').build()
```

This will create a `Person` object with a name of "John", an age of 30, and an address of "123 Main St.".

Overall, the Fluent Builder pattern can make your code more readable and maintainable by providing a clean, intuitive way to create complex objects with many optional properties.
