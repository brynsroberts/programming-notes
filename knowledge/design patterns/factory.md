The Factory Pattern is a [[creational]] [[design pattern]] that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In Python, the Factory Pattern can be implemented using a class hierarchy and a factory method.

Here's an example implementation of the Factory Pattern in Python:

```python
class Product:
    def get_details(self):
        pass

class ProductA(Product):
    def get_details(self):
        return "Product A"

class ProductB(Product):
    def get_details(self):
        return "Product B"

class ProductFactory:
    def create_product(self, product_type):
        if product_type == "A":
            return ProductA()
        elif product_type == "B":
            return ProductB()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid product type")

# Example usage
product_factory = ProductFactory()

product_a = product_factory.create_product("A")
print(product_a.get_details()) # Output: Product A

product_b = product_factory.create_product("B")
print(product_b.get_details()) # Output: Product B
```

In this example, we have a superclass `Product` and two subclasses `ProductA` and `ProductB`. Each subclass overrides the `get_details` method to return a different string.

We also have a `ProductFactory` class that provides a `create_product` method that takes a `product_type` argument and returns an instance of the corresponding subclass. If an invalid `product_type` is provided, a `ValueError` is raised.

To create a new product, we call the `create_product` method on an instance of `ProductFactory`, passing in the desired `product_type`. The `create_product` method then creates a new instance of the corresponding subclass and returns it.

By using the Factory Pattern in this way, we can create new products without having to know the exact implementation details of each subclass. This makes our code more flexible and easier to maintain.
