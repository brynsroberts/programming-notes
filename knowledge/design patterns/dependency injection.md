Dependency injection is a [[design pattern]] used in software engineering to implement [[Inversion of Control]] (IoC) and enable loose coupling between different components of an application. The main idea behind dependency injection is to provide the required dependencies to a component from an external source, rather than having the component create or manage those dependencies itself.

In other words, instead of creating objects directly within a class or function, dependencies are injected from an external source, such as a configuration file, a factory class, or another component responsible for managing the lifecycle of those dependencies.

The benefits of dependency injection include:

-   Loose coupling: Components are not tightly coupled to their dependencies, which makes it easier to change, test, and maintain the application.

-   Reusability: Components can be reused across different applications or contexts because they are not tied to specific implementations of their dependencies.

-   Testability: Components can be easily tested in isolation because their dependencies can be replaced with mock objects or other test-specific implementations.

There are several ways to implement dependency injection in [[Python]]:

1.  Constructor injection: Dependencies are passed to a component's constructor as arguments. This is the most common type of dependency injection in Python.

2.  Setter injection: Dependencies are passed to a component's setter methods as arguments.

3.  Interface injection: A component implements an interface that defines the required dependencies. Other components can then provide implementations of that interface to satisfy the dependencies.

Here's an example of constructor injection in Python:

```python
class MyComponent:
    def __init__(self, dependency):
        self.dependency = dependency

    def do_something(self):
        self.dependency.do_something_else()

class MyDependency:
    def do_something_else(self):
        print("Doing something else")

dependency = MyDependency()
component = MyComponent(dependency)
component.do_something()
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` class has a dependency on the `MyDependency` class, which is passed to the constructor as an argument. The `do_something()` method of `MyComponent` uses the `do_something_else()` method of the `MyDependency` instance.

By using constructor injection, the `MyComponent` class is not tightly coupled to the `MyDependency` class, and can be easily tested and reused with different implementations of that dependency.
