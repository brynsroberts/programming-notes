The Adapter [[design pattern]] is a [[structural design pattern]] that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves creating a wrapper object that adapts one interface to another.

Here's an example implementation of the Adapter pattern in Python:

```python
class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return "Specific request from Adaptee"


class Target:
    def request(self):
        return "Default request from Target"


class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        return self.adaptee.specific_request()


adaptee = Adaptee()
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
print(adapter.request())  # Output: "Specific request from Adaptee"
```


In this example, we have an `Adaptee` class that has a `specific_request` method. We also have a `Target` class that has a `request` method. However, these two classes have incompatible interfaces.

To make them work together, we create an `Adapter` class that inherits from the `Target` class. We pass an instance of the `Adaptee` class to the `Adapter` constructor, which allows the `Adapter` class to call the `specific_request` method of the `Adaptee` class.

When we call the `request` method on the `Adapter` object, it internally calls the `specific_request` method of the `Adaptee` object and returns the result.

This allows us to use the `Adaptee` class in conjunction with the `Target` class even though they have incompatible interfaces.

Overall, the Adapter [[design pattern]] is useful when we want to reuse existing classes that have incompatible interfaces, or when we want to make our code more modular by separating the interface from the implementation.
