To replace text in a full directory using [[bash]], you can use the `find` command to locate all the files you want to modify, and then use a command like `sed` to perform the replacement.

Here's an example command that replaces all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in all `.txt` files in the current directory and all subdirectories:

```bash
find . -type f -name '*.txt' -exec sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' {} +
```

Here's how this command works:

-   `find .`: Search the current directory (`.`) and all subdirectories.
-   `-type f`: Only consider files (not directories or other types of files).
-   `-name '*.txt'`: Only consider files that match the pattern `*.txt`.
-   `-exec`: Execute a command for each file found.
-   `sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' {} +`: This command replaces "foo" with "bar" in each file (`{}`), using the `sed` command with the `-i` option to edit the files in place, and the `g` option to replace all occurrences of "foo" in each line.

You can modify this command to replace different patterns or use different file types by changing the arguments to `find` and `sed`.
