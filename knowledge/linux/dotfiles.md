Dotfiles are hidden files in [[Linux]] and other Unix-like operating systems that are usually located in a user's home directory and have filenames that begin with a dot or period (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`). These files are often used to store user-specific configurations for various applications and command-line utilities.

Dotfiles are hidden by default because they are not meant to be edited by casual users and their presence in the user's home directory can clutter the view. In order to view hidden files, you need to enable the display of hidden files in the file manager or use the `ls -a` command in the terminal.

Some common examples of dotfiles and their uses include:

1.  `.bashrc` - contains configuration settings for the Bash shell, such as aliases, environment variables, and shell options.
2.  `.vimrc` - contains configuration settings for the Vim text editor, such as key mappings and syntax highlighting.
3.  `.gitconfig` - contains configuration settings for the Git version control system, such as user name and email address, default text editor, and aliases.

Dotfiles are an important part of the Unix philosophy of "configuration as code," where system configuration is treated as code and version-controlled like any other software code. This approach allows for easy sharing and replication of user-specific configurations across different machines or environments.
