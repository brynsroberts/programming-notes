A forward proxy, also known as a client-side proxy, is a server that sits between client devices and the internet. When a client device sends a request to the internet, the request is first sent to the forward proxy server. The forward proxy server then forwards the request to the destination server on the client's behalf. The destination server only sees the IP address of the proxy server and not the client's IP address.

Forward proxies are commonly used in corporate environments to enforce security policies, control access to the internet, and improve network performance by caching frequently accessed content. By routing all outgoing requests through a forward proxy, administrators can monitor and control access to specific websites, limit the types of content that can be accessed, and prevent the spread of malware and other security threats.

Forward proxies can also be used to bypass geographical restrictions on content, such as when accessing content that is only available in certain regions or countries. By connecting to a forward proxy server in a different location, users can access content as if they were located in that region.

Overall, forward proxies are a powerful tool for controlling and securing internet access in corporate environments, as well as for accessing restricted content from anywhere in the world.
