The Template [[Design Pattern]] is a [[behavioral design pattern]] that defines the basic steps to execute a certain algorithm, while allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for some of the steps. In Python, you can implement the Template Design Pattern using the following steps:

1.  Create an abstract base class that defines the basic steps of the algorithm. This class should declare abstract methods that will be implemented by its subclasses.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def step_one(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def step_two(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def step_three(self):
        pass

    def template_method(self):
        self.step_one()
        self.step_two()
        self.step_three()
```

2.  Create concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract base class and implement the abstract methods.

```python
class ConcreteClassA(AbstractClass):
    def step_one(self):
        print("Step 1 for ConcreteClassA")

    def step_two(self):
        print("Step 2 for ConcreteClassA")

    def step_three(self):
        print("Step 3 for ConcreteClassA")

class ConcreteClassB(AbstractClass):
    def step_one(self):
        print("Step 1 for ConcreteClassB")

    def step_two(self):
        print("Step 2 for ConcreteClassB")

    def step_three(self):
        print("Step 3 for ConcreteClassB")
```

3.  Create client code that uses the concrete subclasses to execute the algorithm.

```python
def main():
    concrete_a = ConcreteClassA()
    concrete_a.template_method()

    concrete_b = ConcreteClassB()
    concrete_b.template_method()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When the `template_method` is called on an instance of `ConcreteClassA`, it will execute the three steps in the order defined by the abstract base class. Similarly, when it is called on an instance of `ConcreteClassB`, it will execute the three steps in a different order defined by the concrete subclass.

This pattern is useful when you have a set of similar algorithms that share common steps, but also have some steps that are different for each algorithm. By using the Template Design Pattern, you can avoid duplicating code and enforce consistency in the algorithm's structure.
