[[Docker Compose]] supports several types of volumes that you can use to store and manage data. Here are some of the most common types of volumes:

1.  **Host-mounted volumes**: These volumes map a directory on the host machine to a directory in the container. You can use the `-v` option with `docker run` to mount a host directory, or define a `volumes` section in your `docker-compose.yml` file. For example:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - /path/on/host:/path/in/container
```

2.  **Anonymous volumes**: These volumes are created by Docker and assigned a random name. They are useful when you need to share data between containers, but don't want to define a named volume. You can use the `volumes` key to define an anonymous volume in your `docker-compose.yml` file, like this:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  db:
    image: mysql
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql
      - /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
      - /etc/mysql/conf.d

volumes:
  - /var/lib/mysql
  - /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
  - /etc/mysql/conf.d
```

3.  **Named volumes**: These volumes are created by Docker and assigned a specific name that you can use to manage them. Named volumes are useful when you need to share data between containers, or when you want to persist data even after a container is removed. You can define a named volume in your `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  db:
    image: mysql
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
```

4.  **Tmpfs volumes**: These volumes are stored in memory and are useful when you need to store temporary data that doesn't need to be persisted. You can define a tmpfs volume in your `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

These are just a few of the most common types of volumes that you can use with Docker Compose. You can find more information about volumes and how to use them in the Docker documentation.
