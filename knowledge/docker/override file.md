An override file for [[Docker Compose]] allows you to customize and override the default settings of a Compose file without modifying the original file.

The override file can be used to define additional services or containers, change the configuration settings of existing services, or modify environment variables, ports, volumes, and other parameters.

Using an override file has several benefits:

1.  Flexibility: By using an override file, you can easily change the configuration of a Compose file without modifying the original file. This makes it easy to customize your environment for different use cases or environments.

2.  Reusability: An override file can be shared across different environments and projects, which can help to save time and reduce errors.

3.  Maintainability: Using an override file can make it easier to maintain and update your Compose file, as you can keep the base file and override file separate and make changes only where necessary.

Overall, an override file for Docker Compose provides a powerful tool for customizing and managing your containerized environment, making it more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.
