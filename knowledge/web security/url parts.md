A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) typically consists of several parts:

1.  Scheme/Protocol: The scheme or protocol indicates the protocol to be used to access the resource. Examples include http, https, ftp, file, etc.
    
2.  Domain Name: The domain name identifies the server hosting the resource. It is also known as the host or hostname. For example, [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/).
    
3.  Port: The port number is used to identify a specific process to which the data is being sent on the server. It is typically separated from the domain name by a colon. For example, [www.example.com:8080](http://www.example.com:8080/).
    
4.  Path: The path identifies the location of the resource on the server. It is often represented by a series of directory and file names separated by slashes. For example, /resources/docs/file.html.
    
5.  Query string: The query string is used to pass parameters to the resource being accessed. It is typically separated from the path by a question mark and consists of a series of key-value pairs separated by an ampersand. For example, /search?q=example&category=books.
    
6.  Fragment: The fragment is used to identify a specific portion of the resource being accessed, such as a particular section of a long document or a specific location on a web page. It is typically separated from the rest of the URL by a hash symbol. For example, /page.html#section-2.
