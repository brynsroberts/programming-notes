The Singleton [[design pattern]] is a [[creational pattern]] that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. In Python, you can implement the Singleton pattern in several ways, but one common approach is to use a class decorator.

Here's an example implementation of the Singleton pattern using a class decorator:

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

# Create instances
a = MyClass("instance 1")
b = MyClass("instance 2")

# Both variables refer to the same instance
print(a is b) # True
print(a.arg)  # "instance 1"
print(b.arg)  # "instance 1"
```

In this implementation, the `singleton` function is a [[decorator]] that takes a class as an argument, and returns a function that will create and return a single instance of the class. The `instances` dictionary is used to store the single instance of each class.

When the decorator is applied to a class, it replaces the original class definition with the `get_instance` function, which checks if an instance of the class has already been created. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in the `instances` dictionary. If an instance already exists, it returns that instance.

In the example above, we create two instances of the `MyClass` class, but they both refer to the same instance. This demonstrates that the Singleton pattern is working as intended.
