To find and replace text within a file in place, meaning directly modifying the original file without creating a new file, you can use the `-i` flag with the `sed` command in Unix-based systems, such as Linux or macOS. The `-i` flag stands for in-place editing.

Here is the syntax for using [[sed]] to find and replace text within a file in place:

```bash
sed -i 's/search_pattern/replace_string/g' file_name
```

On mac use the following command:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/search_pattern/replace_string/g' file_name
```

Let's break down this command:

-   `sed` is the command we're using to invoke the stream editor.
-   `-i` is the flag that enables in-place editing of the file.
-   `'s/search_pattern/replace_string/g'` is the search and replace pattern we want to use. In this pattern, `search_pattern` is the text you want to find, and `replace_string` is the text you want to replace it with. The `g` flag at the end means that all instances of `search_pattern` in the file will be replaced, not just the first instance.
-   `file_name` is the name of the file you want to make changes to.
