`chmod` is a command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that is used to change the [[permissions]] of files and directories. The `chmod` command can be used to grant or revoke permissions for the owner, group, and other users to read, write, and execute a file.

The syntax for the `chmod` command is as follows:

`chmod [options] mode file`

Here, `options` refer to any additional options that you may want to specify with the command, `mode` specifies the new permissions that you want to set, and `file` is the name of the file or directory for which you want to change permissions.

Here are some examples of how to use the `chmod` command:

-   To give the owner of a file read, write, and execute permissions, and to give the group and other users only read and execute permissions, you would run the following command:

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

 Here, `7` indicates that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions (4+2+1 = 7), `5` indicates that the group and other users have read and execute permissions (4+1 = 5), and `filename` is the name of the file you want to modify.

-   To remove write permission from the group and other users for a file, you would run the following command:

```bash
chmod go-w filename
```

Here, `go` refers to the group and other users, and `-w` removes the write permission from the file for the specified users.

-   To give all users (owner, group, and other) full permissions (read, write, and execute) for a file, you would run the following command:

```bash
chmod a+rwx filename
```

Here, `a` refers to all users, and `+rwx` grants read, write, and execute permissions to the file for all users.

Note that the `chmod` command can also be used with symbolic notation, where `u` refers to the owner, `g` refers to the group, `o` refers to other users, `a` refers to all users, `+` adds permissions, and `-` removes permissions. For example, `chmod u+x filename` adds execute permission for the owner of the file.
