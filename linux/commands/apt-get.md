`apt-get` is a command-line tool used on Linux-based operating systems (such as Ubuntu and Debian) for package management. It allows users to search, install, update, and remove software packages from their system.

Here are some commonly used commands with `apt-get`:

-   `sudo apt-get update`: Updates the local package list, which is used to identify and download the latest version of packages available for installation.
-   `sudo apt-get upgrade`: Upgrades all installed packages to their latest version.
-   `sudo apt-get install package_name`: Installs a new package on the system. Replace "package_name" with the name of the package you want to install.
-   `sudo apt-get remove package_name`: Removes a package from the system. Replace "package_name" with the name of the package you want to remove.
-   `sudo apt-get autoremove`: Removes packages that were automatically installed as dependencies of other packages, but are no longer required.
-   `sudo apt-get clean`: Deletes the cached package files that are no longer needed.
-   `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`: Upgrades the system to the latest available version of the distribution, including kernel upgrades and major package updates.
