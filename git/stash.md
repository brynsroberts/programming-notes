`git stash` is a useful command in Git that allows you to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, so you can work on something else or switch to another branch without losing your changes. Here's how you can use `git stash` on the command line:

 1) Make changes to your code, but do not commit them yet.
 2) Use the `git stash` command to temporarily save your changes:

```bash
git stash save "Your stash message here
```


This will create a new stash with a message that describes the changes you've made.

3.  Use the `git stash list` command to see a list of all the stashes you've created:


```bash
git stash list
```


This will show you a list of all the stashes you've created, including their names and messages.

4.  Use the `git stash apply` command to retrieve your changes:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```


This will apply the most recent stash. If you have multiple stashes, you can specify a particular stash to apply by replacing `stash@{0}` with the name or index of the stash you want to apply.

5.  Use the `git stash drop` command to remove the stash:

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```


This will remove the most recent stash. Again, you can specify a particular stash to remove by replacing `stash@{0}` with the name or index of the stash you want to remove.

Alternatively, you can use the `git stash pop` command to apply and remove the most recent stash in one step:

```bash
git stash pop
```


This will apply the most recent stash and remove it from the list of stashes.

Note that `git stash` is a powerful command, and it's easy to accidentally lose changes or create conflicts if you're not careful. Make sure you understand the implications of using `git stash` before you start using it in your workflow.
