`git cherry-pick` is a Git command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. The command allows you to select a commit that was previously committed to another branch and apply it to the current branch.

This can be useful in situations where you want to apply a specific change made in another branch to your current branch without merging the entire branch.

The syntax for using `git cherry-pick` is as follows:

```shell
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

where `<commit-hash>` is the hash of the commit you want to apply to the current branch.

When you run the `git cherry-pick` command, Git will create a new commit that applies the changes made in the specified commit on top of the current branch's HEAD.

It's important to note that `git cherry-pick` only applies the changes made in the specified commit and not the entire history of the branch. Therefore, if the commit you're cherry-picking depends on other commits that are not present in your current branch, you may run into conflicts that you'll need to resolve manually.
