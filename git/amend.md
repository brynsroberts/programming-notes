`git commit --amend` is a command in Git that allows you to modify the most recent commit message or make additional changes to the previous commit. Here's how to use it:

1.  Make changes to your code.
2.  Stage your changes with `git add`.

```bash
git add file1 file2 file3
```

3.  Commit your changes with the `--amend` flag:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

This will open your default text editor with the commit message of the most recent commit.

4.  Edit the commit message or add additional changes to the commit.
5.  Save and close the file.
6.  Review the new commit with `git log` or `git show`.

```bash
git log --oneline
```


This will show you the latest commit and the new commit message.

Note that using `git commit --amend` will replace the most recent commit with the new commit. If you have already pushed the commit to a remote repository, you will need to force push the changes with `git push --force`. Be careful when using `--amend` as it can be a destructive action if used improperly.

Also note that if you have already pushed the commit to a remote repository and other people have pulled it down, using `git commit --amend` to modify the commit history can cause problems for those other people. It's generally best to avoid modifying commit history after it has been pushed to a remote repository unless you are certain that it won't cause any issues.
