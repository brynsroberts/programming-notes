`git clean` is a Git command used to remove untracked files from the working directory of your repository. These are files that Git is not tracking because they haven't been added to the repository, but they may still exist in your working directory.

The `git clean` command has several options that allow you to control which files are removed. Here are some common options:

-   `-n` or `--dry-run`: This option shows you what files would be removed without actually deleting them.

-   `-f` or `--force`: This option forces Git to remove the files without prompting you for confirmation.

-   `-i` or `--interactive`: This option runs `git clean` in interactive mode, which allows you to select which files to remove from a list of untracked files.

-   `-d` or `--directory`: This option tells Git to remove untracked directories in addition to files.

It's important to note that `git clean` permanently deletes untracked files, so use it with caution. You can use `git status` to see which files are untracked before running `git clean` to avoid accidentally deleting important files.
